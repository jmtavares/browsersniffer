# Browser Sniffer

Browser Sniffer aggregates information about the browser (browser name, operating system, screen capabilities, performance measures).

It uses [Bowser](https://github.com/ded/bowser) to detect the browser. You can check in the Bowser Repository the full list of devices supported ([User Agents](https://github.com/ded/bowser/blob/master/src/useragents.js)).
 

## Install

``` js
npm install browsersniffer --save-dev
```

Include the minified version (browsersniffer.min.js) in your page and call this method:

``` js
window.browsersniffer.detect();
```

And it will return an object like this:

``` json
